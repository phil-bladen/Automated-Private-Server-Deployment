What's in this folder?
======================
This folder contains ansible playbooks used to configure:
* a private EC2 instance as a bastion
* a public EC2 instance as a server for openVPN connections to that bastion

Great, how do I use these playbooks?
======================
0. Create infrastructure with one public instance and one private instance using Terraform module at /PBLADEN_Project_One
1. In /inventory:
    * insert public IP of public instance under "openvpn" host group
    * insert private IP of private instance under "bastion" host group
    * insert a value for 'employee_id' under the bastion:vars group variables section
    * insert a value for 'my_sns_topic_name' under the bastion:vars group variables section. This corresponds to an SNS topic created in step 0
    * insert a value for 'my_sns_subscription_email' under the bastion:vars group variables section. This is the email address
    you can connect to the to the SNS topic created in step 0
2. Run openvpn.yml to configure your public instance as an OpenVPN server
3. Add the openVPN configuration file generated by Ansible to OpenVPN Connect
* Note: Ansible places this file at /tmp/ansible/vpnuser/{public-instance-ip}.ovpn. You may need to move the file out of /tmp to open the file with OpenVPN Connect
4. Use OpenVPN Connect to start a split-tunnel connection to your private instance
5. Run bastion.yml to configure your private instance as a bastion
